# Extension Icons

The extension requires icon files for the Chrome extension. Currently, placeholder files are included.

## Required Icons

- `icons/icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icons/icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icons/icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editor or online tool:

1. Design a simple icon representing "ClarionChain Lens" or Bitcoin chart analysis
2. Export as PNG files at the required sizes
3. Replace the placeholder files in the `icons/` directory

## Quick Solution

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Or create simple colored squares as placeholders
3. The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome will show a default icon

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Bitcoin symbol (₿) with a lens/magnifying glass
- Chart/graph icon with AI/neural network elements
- Green (#00ff00) color scheme to match the extension theme
- Minimal, modern design suitable for small sizes
